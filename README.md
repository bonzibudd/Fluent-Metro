### What is Fluent-Metro?

This skin brings a modern look and full customization to Open-Shell. It uses design aspects including depth, transparency, and dynamic colors. Additional enhancements include a wide array of customizable options, such as padding and font sizes, color choices, and button appearance. 

### Setup Process

To start, you will need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly regarded Start Menu replacement for Windows and is used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install, copy the Fluent-Metro file(s) into "C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins" so that the skin is recognized. Now, in Open-Shell Menu Settings, navigate to the "Skins" tab. From the dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro (the name may be different on pre-release versions).

**And Voil√†!** The skin will be applied.

### Configurations

As you can see, there is plenty of customization to get the menu looking exactly how you want. Any additional required information is also explained here. For instance, using the Modern shutown button requires you to enable the shutdown dialog in Open-Shell settings. If an option is incompatible with another, it will be grayed out. **If you notice an issue with an option, you can file a bug report on Github.** Additionally, more options will likely be added as new versions of the skin get released.

### Future additions

The next step in development will be adding a Two column style with a tiled interface, as many people prefer that layout for ease of use and familiarity. The skins will continue to be refined by fixing general bugs, adding enhanced usability, and making the interface generally more pleasing with more customization. Other non-Start menu additions may be considered for this repository, like enhancements to File Explorer and the Taskbar. Some of these will be related to Open-Shell, while others may not be. You may expect to see things like Start buttons, Taskbar skins, and icon sets, although none are necessarily guaranteed.
