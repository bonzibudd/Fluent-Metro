A modern, highly customizable Windows 7-style skin for Open-Shell Menu. Compatible with Windows 8, 8.1, and 10.

# Purpose of Fluent-Metro
This skin is an attempt to bring Fluent design into the beloved Open-Shell Start menu. This skin uses modern styles such as curved corners, flat borders, bold fonts, and other cues from Microsoft's style. Additional enhancements include a wide array of customizable options, such as icon and padding size, colors, fonts, and buttons. More options will be added in the future to enhance the experience.

# Setup Process
First of all, you need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly customizable Start Menu replacement for Windows and is loved by enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration. These are useful features but not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install Fluent-Metro, copy the Fluent-Metro.skin7 file into "C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins" so that the program recognizes the skin. Now, in Open-Shell Menu Settings, navigate to the "Skins" tab. From the skin dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro. And Voil√†! The skin will be applied.
**On Windows 8, Big Muscle's Aero Glass is highly recommended. Some visual features are not available without glass enabled.**

# Configuration Options

As you can see, there is an array of customization to get the menu looking exactly how you want. Any additional required information is also explained here. More options will be added as new versions of the skin are released.

# The future of Fluent-Metro

I plan to have multiple variants of the skin, including a Windows XP/Classic style, and versions with sharp edges instead of rounded. My goal is to keep refining this skin, fixing bugs with certain configurations, and add more features to make the UI more consistent. I may also create some enhancements which are not related to the Start menu, but will add some more general enhancements.
