### What is Fluent-Metro?

This skin brings a modern look and full customization to Open-Shell. It uses modern design elements providing depth, transparency, and automatic colors to the Start Menu. Additionally, it provides a wide array of customizable options, including padding and font sizes, color choices, and button appearance. 

## Installation
**Fluent-Metro is designed for Windows 10. It is incompatible with Windows 7, and only partially compatible with 8.**

To start, you will need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly regarded Start Menu replacement for Windows and is used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install, copy the Fluent-Metro file(s) into `C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins` so that the skin is recognized. Head to the Open-Shell Menu Settings and navigate to the Start Menu Style tab. Select "Windows 7 Style." Finally, navigate to the "Skins" tab. From the dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro (the name may be different on pre-release versions).

**And Voil√†!** The skin will be applied.

**If you notice that the menu looks off-color, set the** `Menu glass color` **to #858585 in Open-Shell Settings (under "Menu Look").** This will prevent your accent color from bleeding into the menu background.

**Something else doesn't look right?** Feel free to make a post in the [discussions](https://github.com/bonzibudd/Fluent-Metro/discussions) area.

### Configurations

![Options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61938331/115725902-3b262980-a350-11eb-915c-38ba64abcb0e.png)

As you can see, there is plenty of customization to get the menu looking exactly how you want. Any additional required information is also explained here. For instance, using the modern shutown button requires you to enable the shutdown dialog in Open-Shell settings. If an option is incompatible with another, it will be disabled. **If you notice an issue with an option, you may file a [bug report](https://github.com/bonzibudd/Fluent-Metro/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).** Options will be continually added as updates get released.

### Scripts and Resources
All scripts and resources are available in the individual skin files. If you would like to make changes to the Fluent-Metro skin, download the .skin/.skin7 from the release page and open it with Resource Hacker. If you want to make changes to part of the script, check out the [Open-Shell skinning tutorial](https://coddec.github.io/Classic-Shell/www.classicshell.net/tutorials/skintutorial.html).

### Future development

The next major step in development will be the addition of "Classic" style variants, which include an optional tiled interface. Many people prefer that layout for ease of use and familiarity, and it will be a good addition for people previously using the classic styles. Another goal is to provide an easier method of installation and configuration, for a more traditional approach for people unfamiliar with skinning. Overall, the skins will continue to be refined by fixing bugs, adding more thorough customization, and making the interface more appealing overall. 


In addition to the Start Menu, other types of additions may also be considered, like enhancements to File Explorer and the Taskbar. You may expect to see things like Start buttons, Taskbar skins, and icon sets, although none are currently planned.
