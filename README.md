## What is Fluent-Metro?

This skin is an attempt to bring a modern look and full customization to Open-Shell. It uses modern elements such as curved corners, flat borders, bold fonts, glyphs, depth, and other cues from Fluent design. It even has a floating border! Additional enhancements include a wide array of customizable options, such as icon and padding size, colors choices, fonts sizes, and button appearance. More options will be (and have been) added to enhance the experience.

## Setup Process

First of all, you need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly customizable Start Menu replacement for Windows and is used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install, copy the Fluent-Metro file(s) into "C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins" so that the program recognizes the skin. Note that the file with the ".skin" extension is for the "Classic" and "Two column" styles, while the ".skin7" file is for the Windows 7 style. Now, in Open-Shell Menu Settings, navigate to the "Skins" tab. From the skin dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro.

**And Voil√†!** The skin will be applied.

** On Windows 8, Big Muscle's Aero Glass is highly recommended. Some visual features are currently limited without glass enabled. This may change in the future.

## Configuration Options

As you can see, there is an array of customization to get the menu looking exactly how you want. Any additional required information is also explained here. Options which are incompatible with each other are grayed out, and are grouped in similar areas. **If you notice a possible issue with an option, PLEASE FILE A BUG REPORT!** More options will be (and have been) added as new versions of the skin get released.

## Future additions

The plan is to have more versions of the skin, including variants without rounded corners. I also intend on adding a Two column style with a tile interface, which many users might prefer. I will keep refining this skin by fixing existing bugs with certain configurations, adding enhanced usability for touch screens, and making the interface generally more consistent with Windows. I may also create some enhancements which are not related to the Start menu, but instead, other aspects of Windows, like File Explorer. Some of these will be related to Open-Shell, while others may not be. Expect to see things like Start buttons, Taskbar skins, and more.
