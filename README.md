### What is Fluent-Metro?

This skin brings a modern look and full customization to Open-Shell. It uses modern design aspects including depth, transparency, light/dark backgrounds, and other cues from Windows 10's design system. Additional enhancements include a wide array of customizable options, such as icon and padding sizes, color choices, font sizes, and button appearance. 

### Setup Process

First of all, you need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly customizable Start Menu replacement for Windows and is used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install, copy the Fluent-Metro file(s) into "C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins" so that the program recognizes the skin. Now, in Open-Shell Menu Settings, navigate to the "Skins" tab. From the dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro.

**And Voil√†!** The skin will be applied.

** If you are using Windows 8 (not reccomended), Big Muscle's Aero Glass is suggested to install. Some visual features are limited without glass enabled. This may change in the future.

### Configurations

![Options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61938331/92263545-cb3f5d80-eeaa-11ea-9514-2b06562f1f4f.png)

As you can see, there is plenty of customization to get the menu looking exactly how you want. Any additional required information is also explained here. For instance, using the Modern shutown button requires you to enable the shutdown dialog in Open-Shell settings. If an option is incompatible with another, it will be grayed out. **If you notice a possible issue with an option, PLEASE FILE A BUG REPORT!** More options will be (and have been) added as new versions of the skin get released.

### Future additions

The next step in developing the skin will be to add a Two column style with a tiled interface, which many users prefer for ease of use. This skin will continue to be refined by fixing existing bugs with certain configurations, adding enhanced usability, and making the interface generally more consistent with Windows. Other enhancements may be added which are not related to the Start menu, but instead, other aspects of Windows, like File Explorer and the Taskbar. Some of these will be related to Open-Shell, while others may not be. You can expect to see things like Start buttons, Taskbar skins, icon sets, and other additions, although none are guaranteed to be added.
