### What is Fluent-Metro?

This skin brings a modern look and full customization to Open-Shell. It uses modern design elements providing depth, transparency, and automatic colors to the Start Menu. Additionally, it provides a wide array of customizable options, including padding and font sizes, color choices, and button appearance. 

## Installation
**Fluent-Metro is designed for Windows 10. It is incompatible with Windows 7, and only partially compatible with 8.**

To start, you will need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly regarded Start Menu replacement for Windows and is used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install, copy the Fluent-Metro file(s) into `C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins` so that the skin is recognized. Now, in Open-Shell Menu Settings, navigate to the "Skins" tab. From the dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro (the name may be different on pre-release versions).

**And Voil√†!** The skin will be applied.

**If you notice that the menu looks off-color, set the** `Menu glass color` **to #858585 in Open-Shell Settings.** This will prevent your accent color from bleeding into the menu background.

**Something doesn't look right?** Feel free to make a post in the [discussions](https://github.com/bonzibudd/Fluent-Metro/discussions) area.

### Configurations

As you can see, there is plenty of customization to get the menu looking exactly how you want. Any additional required information is also explained here. For instance, using the modern shutown button requires you to enable the shutdown dialog in Open-Shell settings. If an option is incompatible with another, it will be grayed out. **If you notice an issue with an option, you can file a bug report on Github.** Additionally, more options will likely be added as new versions of the skin get released.


### Scripts and Resources
All scripts and resources are available in the individual skin files. If you would like to make changes to the Fluent-Metro skin, download the .skin/.skin7 from the release page and open it with Resource Hacker. If you want to make changes to part of the script, check out the [Open-Shell skinning tutorial](https://coddec.github.io/Classic-Shell/www.classicshell.net/tutorials/skintutorial.html).


### Future development

The next major step in development will be the addition of a two-column variant with a tiled interface, as many people prefer that layout for ease of use and familiarity. The skins will continue to be refined by fixing general bugs, adding enhanced usability, and making the interface generally more pleasing with thorough customization. Other non-Start menu additions may be considered for this repository, like enhancements to File Explorer and the Taskbar. Some of these could still be related to Open-Shell, while others may not be. You may expect to see things like Start buttons, Taskbar skins, and icon sets, although none are necessarily guaranteed.
