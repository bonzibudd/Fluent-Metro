## What is Fluent-Metro?

This skin is an attempt to bring Fluent design into the beloved Open-Shell Start menu. It uses modern elements such as curved corners, flat borders, bold fonts, glyphs, and other cues from Fluent design. It even has a floating border! Additional enhancements include a wide array of customizable options, such as icon and padding size, colors choices, fonts sizes, and button appearance. More options will be (and have been) added to enhance the experience.

## Setup Process

First of all, you need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly customizable Start Menu replacement for Windows and is loved by enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration. These are useful additions but not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install Fluent-Metro, copy the Fluent-Metro file(s) into "C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins" so that the program recognizes the skin. Note that the file with the ".skin" extension is for the "Classic" and "Two column" styles, while the ".skin7" file is for the Windows 7 style. Now, in Open-Shell Menu Settings, navigate to the "Skins" tab. From the skin dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro.

**And Voil√†!** The skin will be applied.

** On Windows 8, Big Muscle's Aero Glass is highly recommended. Some visual features are currently limited without glass enabled. This may change in the future.
