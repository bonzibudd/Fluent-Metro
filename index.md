## Fluent-Metro for Open-Shell Menu
## What is Fluent-Metro?

This skin is an attempt to bring a modern look and full customization to Open-Shell. It uses modern elements such as curved corners, flat borders, bold fonts, glyphs, depth, and other cues from Fluent design. It even has a floating border! Additional enhancements include a wide array of customizable options, such as icon and padding size, colors choices, fonts sizes, and button appearance. More options will be (and have been) added to enhance the experience.

## Installation
**Fluent-Metro is designed for Windows 10. It is incompatible with Windows 7, and only partially compatible with 8.**

To start, you will need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly regarded Start Menu replacement for Windows and is used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install, copy the Fluent-Metro file(s) into `C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins` so that the skin is recognized. Head to the Open-Shell Menu Settings and navigate to the Start Menu Style tab. Select "Windows 7 Style." Finally, navigate to the "Skins" tab. From the dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro (the name may be different on pre-release versions).

**And Voil√†!** The skin will be applied.

**If you notice that the menu looks off-color, set the** `Menu glass color` **to #858585 in Open-Shell Settings (under "Menu Look").** This will prevent your accent color from bleeding into the menu background.

## Future development

The next major step in development will be the addition of "Classic" style variants, which include an optional tiled interface. Many people prefer that layout for ease of use and familiarity, and it will be a good addition for people previously using the classic styles. Another goal is to provide an easier method of installation and configuration, for a more traditional approach for people unfamiliar with skinning. Overall, the skins will continue to be refined by fixing bugs, adding more thorough customization, and making the interface more appealing overall. 


In addition to the Start Menu, other types of additions may also be considered, like enhancements to File Explorer and the Taskbar. You may expect to see things like Start buttons, Taskbar skins, and icon sets, although none are currently planned.
