## What is Fluent-Metro?

This skin brings a modern look and full customization to Open-Shell. It uses refreshed design elements with transparency and depth, following the design of Windows 10. 

Some enhancements include:
 - Use of Windows 10's system colors, providing automatic light/dark colorization
 - Customizable text and background colors, along with accent color
 - Various options for padding and layout sizes
 - Updated icons, matching Windows 10's Fluent icons
 - Improved scaling of menu elements (padding, icons, etc.)

## Installation
**Fluent-Metro is designed for Windows 10. It is incompatible with Windows 7 and 8.**

To start, you will need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly regarded Start Menu replacement for Windows and is used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install, copy the `Fluent-Metro.skin` and `.skin7` files into `C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins` so the skin is recognized by Open-Shell. Next, navigate to the "Skins" tab, and from the dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro (the name may be different on pre-release versions).

**If you're using the Classic variant and want to enable tiles,** select `Backup` -> `Load from XML File...` and select the XML file from the downloaded release. (Make sure to unzip!)

**And Voil√†!** The new interface will be applied. You can further change the links for the tiles under "Customize Start Menu."

**If you notice that the menu looks off-color, set the** `Menu glass color` **to #858585 in Open-Shell Settings (under "Menu Look").** This will prevent your accent color from bleeding into the menu background.

**Something else doesn't look right?** Feel free to make a post in the [discussions](https://github.com/bonzibudd/Fluent-Metro/discussions) area.

## Future development

The next major step in development will be the addition of "Classic" style variants, which include an optional tiled interface. Many people prefer that layout for ease of use and familiarity, and it will be a good addition for people previously using the classic styles. Another goal is to provide an easier method of installation and configuration, for a more traditional approach for people unfamiliar with skinning. Overall, the skins will continue to be refined by fixing bugs, adding more thorough customization, and making the interface more appealing overall. 


In addition to the Start Menu, other types of additions may also be considered, like enhancements to File Explorer and the Taskbar. You may expect to see things like Start buttons, Taskbar skins, and icon sets, although none are currently planned.
