### What is Fluent-Metro?

This skin is an attempt to bring a modern look and full customization to Open-Shell. It uses modern elements such as curved corners, flat borders, bold fonts, glyphs, depth, and other cues from Fluent design. It even has a floating border! Additional enhancements include a wide array of customizable options, such as icon and padding size, colors choices, fonts sizes, and button appearance. More options will be (and have been) added to enhance the experience.

## Installation
**Fluent-Metro is designed for Windows 10. It is incompatible with Windows 7, and only partially compatible with 8.**

To start, you will need [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly regarded Start Menu replacement for Windows and is used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to not include the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start Menu feature.

To install, copy the Fluent-Metro file(s) into "C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins" so that the skin is recognized. Now, in Open-Shell Menu Settings, navigate to the "Skins" tab. From the dropdown, choose Fluent-Metro (the name may be different on pre-release versions).

**And Voil√†!** The skin will be applied.
